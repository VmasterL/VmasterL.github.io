<h2>Athletic Development</h2>

<p>I started swimming when I was 8 years old as a novice swimmer and have gradually and steadily improved every year.  I continue to focus a great deal of my year on swimming and really enjoy my teammates and the competitions I get to go to all over the province.  I have also run with school teams for a few years.  I have only begun cycling in the last 2 years taking my time to learn more skills and get comfortable out on the roads.</p>
